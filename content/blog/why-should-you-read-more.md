Uncle Buffett gave advice a few years ago that there are two skills that can increase your value by 50%, which is the ability to write and convey clear messages.

> “The one easy way to become worth 50 percent more than you are now — at least — is to hone your communication skills — both written and verbal,” says Buffett in a video posted on LinkedIn on Monday.

> “And the transmission is communication,” says Buffett, who is currently worth more than $86 billion, according to Forbes.

Billionaire Branson also has a similar opinion. The essential skill for success in today's life is "storytelling ability".

> Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson agrees that being able to communicate effectively is critical to success.
> “Today, if you want to succeed as an entrepreneur, you also have to be a storyteller,” the British businessman said in 2016 blog post.

But what you said is missing one thing. If you want to write and convey a clear message, you must read a lot. This comes from my personal experience in teaching and supervising students who write reports. There are several stories.

The first story, which I encounter every year, is about writing a master's thesis. My fellow Master's students write their theses, but when I read them, I want to bang my head against the wall 20 times. The reason is that they can't write a logical research question. For example, they say that after China changes its accounting regime, they predict that current earnings data will better forecast future cash flows, but they can't provide a decent explanation! Why? Because they don't read enough. They only read the basic introductory materials I provide, but they don't delve deeper into the literature to understand how the change in accounting regime in China will affect the balance sheet, LIFO accounting, lease accounting, and the recognition of financial statement items, and how it will ultimately impact cash flows. Then, they can't link it all together. I can come up with 2-3 transmission mechanisms in just 5 minutes. Why? Because I read a lot. When you know many stories, you can link them together easily."

The second story is about writing reports. I've supervised many students doing reports from the UK to Australia. In a report, the first page almost decides everything, but young people almost never have the ability to make their first page hot. They repeat a lot of things that other reports have already written, so why do people need to pay a few thousand dollars for you to write a report when they can spend a few hundred dollars to register for FT, CNBC, and get similar articles written even better? Your selling point needs to be exceptional. But why can't you highlight that selling point? Because you don't read enough to know that you need to eliminate 99% of the information that people can already get from other reports, Bloomberg, FT, CNBC.

You only need to focus on that 1% that you see, or even if there's nothing new, but you help people filter out 90% of the news and reports that are unlikely to happen, and only 10% of the ideas presented are ones you think are likely to happen. You filter information to help people like that, and busy people pay you for it. You can't filter information if you don't read enough to know what's valuable. Why do people have to pay a high price for me to do a job that someone else could do 90% as well for 1/3 the price? Because I read more than those others, and that reading capital accumulates, so depending on the market situation, I know what's noise and what's core information, and I also know what readers want.

The third story is a recent one. A deputy editor asked me to write an article, but I was too busy and declined. The other day, he messaged me again, saying that the article he had someone else write instead was a failure, and asked if I could help him write it quickly. I managed to crank out 1200 words during my 40-minute lunch break and sent it to him. How did I come up with words so easily? Because I read a lot, and my head is filled with topics and ideas. I'm just too lazy to write articles because I've been too busy lately, so I wanted to give myself a break.

Finally, I make money from investments, which is also thanks to my reading habits. I read a lot, so I know what's trending in the real estate market, whether stocks are overheating or not, where the money is flowing, who's really interested in Web3, that crypto miners are about to run out of money to pay their electricity bills, and so on.

I make money by writing articles, from research articles, market reports, finding trading ideas for others as well as myself, and then also writing articles. I also teach, translate books, and give talks (which people jokingly call being a speaker, but have never really acted). Those are my main income streams.

All of that comes from just one thing: reading.

And then, people come to me with insider information through my network model because I read a lot, listen a lot, and know a lot, so people seek me out to exchange information and hear my views. It's not like people naturally share insider information with you.
People want to hear your comments to feel reassured or relieved. A single joke of mine after sharing some insider information can sometimes dispel many of their worries. You can only do these things if you know what's going on in their context. And to do that, you need to read a lot to know enough.
You want to write well, speak well, you need to start with reading a lot. Reading a lot is the first step. Then, of course, there's creativity, thinking, turning what you've read into your own, and so on. But those are later steps. If you want to make writing and speaking clearly a key skill of yours, like Warren Buffett says, then you need to READ.
